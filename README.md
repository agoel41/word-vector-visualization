# Word-vector-visualization
Gensim word vector visualization of various word vectors

### Pre-requisites
- Install gensim package using the following command
  - ```pip install -U gensim```
- Download the Glove word embeddings
  - https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.


### Packages used
- ***Gensim***: It isn't really a deep learning package. It's a package for word and text similarity modeling, which started with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA-style) topic models and grew into SVD and neural word representations. But its efficient and scalable, and quite widely used. https://pypi.org/project/gensim/ 

### Project structure
- ***word-vector-visualization.ipynb***: This notebook contains the visualization of the 100 dimensional word embeddings using PCA model.
